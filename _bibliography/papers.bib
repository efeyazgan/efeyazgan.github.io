    abstract = {Human activity continues to have an enormous negative impact on the ability of the planet to sustain human and other forms of life. Six out of the nine planetary boundaries have been crossed, a seventh is close to threshold. Prominent manifestations of this development are climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions, as well as loss of biodiversity. In recognition of the urgency of these problems, several international agreements have been ratified to achieve net-zero emissions and to halt and reverse biodiversity loss. Significant reductions in emissions are required by 2030 to meet international climate targets. The field of particle physics has an obligation and an opportunity to contribute to such mitigation efforts and to avoid causing further harm. This document urges the European Strategy Update in Particle Physics to set a clear and bold mandate for embedding environmental sustainability throughout the future scientific programme, and advocates for a series of actions that will enable this.}

   abstract = {The top quark mass is one of the most intriguing parameters of the standard model (SM). Its value indicates a Yukawa coupling close to unity, and the resulting strong ties to Higgs physics make the top quark mass a crucial ingredient for understanding essential aspects of the electroweak sector of the SM. This review offers the first comprehensive overview of the top quark mass measurements performed by the CMS Collaboration using the data collected at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8, and 13 TeV. Moreover, a detailed description of the top quark event reconstruction is provided and dedicated studies of the dominant uncertainties in the modelling of the signal processes are discussed. The interpretation of the experimental results on the top quark mass in terms of the SM Lagrangian parameter is challenging and is a focus of an ongoing discussion in the theory community. The CMS Collaboration has performed two main types of top quark mass measurements, addressing this challenge from different perspectives: highly precise ‘direct’ measurements, based on reconstructed top quark decay products and relying exclusively on Monte-Carlo simulations, as well as ‘indirect’ measurements, where the simulations are employed to determine parton-level cross sections that are compared to fixed-order perturbative calculations. Recent mass extractions using Lorentz-boosted top quarks open a new avenue of measurements based on top quark decay products contained in a single particle jet, with promising prospects for accurate theoretical interpretations.}

     abstract = {The hunt for top quarks began back in the 1970s after the proposal of the sixquark model by Kobayashi and Maskawa, and it was discovered in 1995 at the Fermilab Tevatron. It was experimentally established by five different experiments in different production modes and a variety of collision energies. At the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), top quark–antiquark pairs are routinely produced at a rate of about six per minute, enabling experiments to make detailed measurements of the properties of top quarks. The analysis of the data collected at the Tevatron and the LHC experiments has revealed, so far, good agreement with the standard model (SM) predictions. The top quark is the most massive elementary particle identified to date: not only does it have a privileged Yukawa coupling to the Higgs boson, but its mass is also significantly higher than that of the Higgs boson. Owing to its large mass, the top quark decays before hadronization, making the study of “bare” quark properties possible in experimental settings. Therefore, top quark physics simultaneously pushes the frontiers of quantum chromodynamics, electroweak, and flavor physics. The aim of this reprint is to provide a comprehensive review of the status and prospects of top quark physics at the LHC and possible future colliders. We have included articles that especially emphasize where the present understanding is incomplete and suggest new directions for research in this area.}

Guided by the experimental needs and requirements, we highlight areas of active development, and opportunities for future improvements. Particular emphasis is given to physics models and algorithms that are employed across a variety of experiments. These common themes in event generator development lead to a more comprehensive understanding of physics at the highest energies and intensities, and allow models to be tested against a wealth of data that have been accumulated over the past decades. A cohesive approach to event generator development will allow these models to be further improved and systematic uncertainties to be reduced, directly contributing to future experimental success. Event generators are part of a much larger ecosystem of computational tools. They typically involve a number of unknown model parameters that must be tuned to experimental data, while maintaining the integrity of the underlying physics models. Making both these data, and the analyses with which they have been obtained accessible to future users is an essential aspect of open science and data preservation. It ensures the consistency of physics models across a variety of experiments.}},

Prospective applications include metrology, geodesy and measurement of terrestrial mass change due to, e.g., climate change, and fundamental science experiments such as tests of the equivalence principle, searches for dark matter, measurements of gravitational waves and tests of quantum mechanics. We review the current status of cold atom technologies and outline the requirements for their space qualification, including the development paths and the corresponding technical milestones, and identifying possible pathfinder missions to pave the way for missions to exploit the full potential of cold atoms in space. Finally, we present a first draft of a possible road-map for achieving these goals, that we propose for discussion by the interested cold atom, Earth Observation, fundamental physics and other prospective scientific user communities, together with the European Space Agency (ESA) and national space and research funding agencies.}},

MC simulations allow testing Standard Model (SM) with more accurate and precise calculations to understand perturbative QCD as well as electroweak effects, and extrapolations of the irreducible backgrounds to signal phase-space regions for new physics searches or for the measurements of rare SM processes. In the MC codes, there are many pieces, approximations, and parameters and settings to compare to the data and tune. Precise experimental measurements at the LHC require similar level of precision in theoretical calculations. Cross sections measured at the LHC both by ATLAS and CMS experiments cover more than 14 orders of magnitude. So far, SM cross section predictions are found to be in very good agreement with the data. These cross sections are measured at different pp collision energies and compared to prediction up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) for many processes, and recently up to N3LO for some of them.

The simulation of the underlying event provided by the new tunes is interfaced to a higher-order matrix-element calculation.

The noise rejection algorithms can be applied to LHC collision data at the trigger level or in the offline analysis. The application of the algorithms at the trigger level is shown to remove 90% of noise events with fake missing transverse energy above 100 GeV, which is sufficient for the CMS physics trigger operation.},

To our knowledge, this is the widest range of momenta in which any calorimeter system has been studied. These tests, carried out at the H2 beam-line at CERN, provide a wealth of information, especially at low energies. The analysis of the differences in calorimeter response to charged pions, kaons, protons and antiprotons and a detailed discussion of the underlying phenomena are presented. We also show techniques that apply corrections to the signals from the considerably different electromagnetic (EB) and hadronic (HB) barrel calorimeters in reconstructing the energies of hadrons. Above 5 GeV/c, these corrections improve the energy resolution of the combined system where the stochastic term equals 84.7$\pm$1.6% and the constant term is 7.4$\pm$0.8%. The corrected mean response remains constant within 1.3% rms.},

	abstract = {In the 1930s scientists discovered that the Universe is expanding and that it is quite old. The observation of hydrogen lines in the spectrum of the Sun helped Niels Bohr construct his atomic model in 1912, and understand the optical spectra of atoms. This era marked the transition of astronomy into astrophysics. With the rapid technological progress, scientists were able to study the universe in different ways that enabled them to observe what could not be observed using ordinary telescopes. Technology enabled scientists to see the universe in x-rays, gamma rays, radio waves and even look inside stars with neutrinos. One of the most important results of these developments, the observation of very high energy particles from cosmic distances, led to a complete new branch of physics, namely high energy physics, and provided a valuable tool to understand the very high energy processes going on in the universe such as in shock fronts of supernova remnants. In the 1960s very important discoveries in astrophysics like the microwave background radiation from the Big Bang, quasars, X-ray binaries, pulsars and cosmic X-ray sources followed. A significant interest in astrophysics prevailed and many physicists began to work on these new objects and processes. Among many great physicists, Yakov B. Zeldovich and Igor D. Novikov are worth noting especially because of their efforts which accelerated the theoretical and phenomenological researches in all of these branches of astrophysics. Astrophysics began to push the boundaries of physics and our world view. Astrophysical results were rewarded with Nobel prizes. Three of these Nobel prizes (1974, 1993, 2002) were given to works on neutron stars. This book is mainly devoted to neutron stars and to objects related to them. },

In the first stage a Fonseca type unit cell and its symmetrical counterpart is formed which represents one-fifth of a toroid. In the second stage one-fifth fragment of the torus is fully obtained by applying geometry optimization to the structure obtained in the first stage. In the third stage the torus fragment obtained in the second stage is reproduced five times and connected to each other to generate either toroidal or helical structure. In the last stage a final optimization process is reapplied to get the complete structure desired. },

It is found that the new luminosity function is considerably flatter in the low luminosity part for 400. 1400 MHz luminosity values of radio pulsars together with upper limits of 1400 MHz luminosity for anomalous X-ray pulsars and dim radio quiet neutron stars are presented as a function of both characteristic age and magnetic field.

	abstract = {We put together many observational data of SGRs and AXPs and analyze them with the main purpose to remove contradiction between the real age of these objects and their characteristic times of period change. This work indicates that SGRs and AXPs are neutron stars with magnetic fields up to 3×1014 G at birth, which is less than the possible value in the existing magnetar model. These neutron stars undergo star-quakes and reconnection of magnetic field occurs from time to time. As a result of these processes plasma is ejected from the NS and propeller mechanism starts to work. Due to the propeller effect ˙ P increases and τ decreases. Indeed, high ˙ P values are observed in SGRs and in half of the AXPs. Then, for a long time NS looses its activity, its ˙ P decreases, τ increases and rapid cooling begins. Each NS stage (AXP, SGR, dim) may occur once or several times until the spin period of the neutron star becomes P>10 12 s. At the transition period to the SGR and AXP stages, the magnetic field component perpendicular to the rotation axis may increase up to 2 3 times. Observational data and mainly the data of AXP1E1048-5937 and DRQNS RX J1308.8+2127 support this idea. },

    abstract = {Recent QCD Monte Carlo tuning studies done in the CMS Collaboration are presented. Jet kine-
matics, jet substructure, and underlying event measurements in top quark pair events are dis-
cussed. New CMS PYTHIA 8 event tunes are presented, exploiting Monte Carlo configurations
with consistent parton distribution functions and strong coupling parameter values in the matrix
element and the parton shower, at leading order (LO), next-to-leading order (NLO) and next-to-
next-to-leading order (NNLO). Predictions from PYTHIA 8 obtained with tunes based on NLO
or NNLO PDFs are shown to reliably describe minimum-bias and underlying-event data with a
similar level of agreement to predictions from tunes using LO PDF sets. The tunes are validated
with a range of different measurements and matrix element-parton shower merged configurations.},

	abstract = {We report on the beam test results of a photomultiplier tube (PMT) specially designed to suppress the signal due to Cherenkov light emitted by window glass when impacted by relativistic charged particles. This signal becomes a concern when it is comparable to the true PMT signal, especially in the case of calorimeters, where the response is at the level of a few photoelectrons per GeV. This design allows for placement of these PMTs behind the calorimeter without concern for hot spots from the Cherenkov background.},

@article{Yazgan:2007zz,
	abbr = {thesis},
	abstract = {One of the goals of the LHC is to test the existence of the Higgs boson. This thesis presents a study of the potential to discover the Standard Model Higgs boson in the vector boson fusion (VBF) channel for the Higgs mass range 120- 200 GeV/c2. The decay of Higgs bosons into the WW final state with both W -bosons decaying leptonically is considered. The main backgrounds are tt + j and W +W −jj. This study, based on a full simulation of the CMS detector at the LHC, shows that a 5σ discovery can be done with an integrated luminosity of 12 − 72 fb−1 for 130 − 200 GeV/c2 Higgs bosons. Due to the uncertainties in the backgrounds, it is important to measure the backgrounds from data. This study shows that the major background can be measured directly to 7% with 30 fb−1. After discovering the Higgs boson, it will be crucial to probe its physical properties. A method to measure the Higgs boson mass using transverse mass template distributions is investigated in the VBF channel. iv The performance of the combined CMS electromagnetic and hadronic calorime- ters (EB+HB) was measured at the H2 test beam at the CERN SPS during 2006 with various particles in a large momentum range, 1-350 GeV/c. Another major contribution of this thesis is developing the method to optimize the energy recon- struction for the combined EB+HB system with which the corrected responses become 100% with 6% fl and the stochastic resolution is improved from 111% to 94%.},

    abstract = {In this thesis, an up-to-date review of intermediate type cataclysmic variables are made emphasizing timing characteristics. Fundamental timing analysis methods are introduced. Timing analysis on the intermediate polar AE Aquarii is per formed using three sets of ROSAT archival data. We have done timing and spec tral analysis on the intermediate polar YY Draconis using ASCA and ROSAT archival data sets. We have investigated the energetics of the pulse profiles. It is found that X-ray pulse profiles of YY Dra decreases with increasing energy. It is also found that the X-ray spectrum of YY Draconis can be represented by single or multitemperature bremsstrahlung and/or VMEKAL models. Lastly, the implication of our analysis is discussed in the light of current theory and observations.},
