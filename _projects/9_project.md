A cataclysmic variable (CV) is a close interacting binary
system in which a white dwarf (WD) accretes material from its
late-type low mass main sequence companion.
CVs can be studied in two main classes: non-magnetic CVs (that are
characterized by their eruptive behavior) and magnetic CVs (MCVs). MCVs
are divided into two sub-classes according to the
degree of synchronization of the binary. Synchronization is caused by the
interaction of the magnetic fields of the WD and the companion star.
If a system is highly synchronized, then it is called a Polar type MCV or an AM Her star;
otherwise it is called an Intermediate Polar (IP) or a DQ Her star. A
review of CVs can be found in Warner (Cataclysmic Variable Stars, Cambridge
University Press, Cambridge 1995).

In the  evolutionary  sequence, the secondary star fills its Roche lobe
and consequently the WD starts to accrete matter from its companion.  
Due to the angular
momentum of the accreting matter, the  material starts circulating
around the WD, forming an accretion disk. However, the infalling plasma is
channeled  on to  the magnetic field lines of the WD at around the Alfven
radius.  In the case of IPs,
a disk remains outside the Alfven radius, since the magnetic field   
strength of these stars are medium range. On the other hand, Polars
have no
accretion disks due to the large value of the Alfven radius which exceeds
the L1 (inner Lagrangian) point of the binary. In both types of
binaries the final impact of the plasma occurs at the magnetic poles of
the WD. The radial infall velocity of the plasma is calculated   
to be in the range of 3000-10000 km/s which is greater than the sonic speed  
$$ \approx $$100 km/s (Patterson PASP,106, 209
1994).  Therefore,  the infalling plasma
releases its
energy  in a shock as it is coming to a stop above the magnetic poles of
the WD. The resulting shock has T$$ \approx{10^8} $$K and emits
hard X-rays. In addition,  if  the
poles  are inclined to the spin axis, intensity modulations of the
X-ray, UV and optical light will be observed at the spin period, one of
its harmonics (eg., $$ {\bf two~pole} $$ accretion) or sidebands (i.e.,
due to reprocessed light from structures fixed in the reference frame of the
binary or material over-flowing the disk).

Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>



The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
